# Selfhear
Study of the sound wave which speakers hear themselves.
This study is to understand how humans hear their voice differently than others hear. The experiment was simulated from the MRI pictures and Human organ acoustics property database (ex., sound absorption coefficient).

## Simulator
Simulating Sound Travelsal trough the human model by each sound frequency

## iOS Survey Logger
An iOS app for statitical experiment. Using Firebase and cloud functions [repo](https://github.com/Selfhear/Cloud-function-Selfhear) for backends.

### Conclusion
Both the Simulator and Interactive survey show the same trend that the sound which speaker hear themself have a lower pitch than when other people listen to them. As a result of bone and muscle sound absorption between the origin of the voice (Througt) and the reciving area (Inner ears).
